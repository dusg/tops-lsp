## Notes

- Reviewed the specification against every item above on 2026-10-10.
- The specification defines the required AST/index records, document/header/context version behavior, partial and degraded results, missing-header behavior, multi-file navigation, and standard LSP contracts for definition, references, and document symbols.
- No clarification markers remain; the document is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
